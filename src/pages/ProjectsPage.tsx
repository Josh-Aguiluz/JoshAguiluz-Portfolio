      "As the Backend & Full-Stack Developer for Danono's Bakery, I was responsible for the entire server-side architecture and frontend implementation of this real-world e-commerce platform for a bakery based in Angeles City, Pampanga.",
      "I developed the backend logic using PHP, handling product catalog management, order processing, and customer data. The server-side code ensures seamless ordering functionality, allowing customers to browse the menu and place orders for their signature 24-hour fermented brioche doughnuts.",
      "On the frontend, I designed and implemented a vibrant, fully responsive UI using CSS and JavaScript that showcases the bakery's brand identity. The design emphasizes visual appeal with high-quality imagery and smooth interactions to create an engaging user experience.",
      "This project taught me the importance of bridging design with functionality — building a system that not only looks premium but also handles real customer transactions reliably. The site is live and actively serving the business at danonos.com."

      "As the Backend & Full-Stack Developer for HAU Eco-Quest, I architected and built this gamified sustainability platform from the ground up using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).",
      "My primary responsibility was designing and implementing the entire backend infrastructure. This included building secure RESTful API endpoints, integrating JWT-based authentication for user sessions, and implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to differentiate between admin and regular user permissions.",
      "I designed the MongoDB data layer with Mongoose schemas to manage user profiles, sustainability challenges, leaderboards, and activity tracking. The backend handles complex game logic including point systems, badge achievements, and progress tracking that gamifies eco-friendly actions on campus.",
      "On the frontend, I worked with React to build the user-facing interface that connects to the API, displaying real-time leaderboards, challenge progress, and user dashboards. The application is deployed on Vercel and demonstrates my ability to build and deploy production-ready full-stack applications."

      "On the technical side, I built a custom Admin Content Management System (CMS) that allows the store owner to manage products, categories, and inventory in real time. I implemented secure shopping cart logic with session management, order processing, and input validation to prevent common security vulnerabilities.",
      "The backend is powered by PHP with MySQL for persistent data storage, handling product CRUD operations, user authentication, and order management. The frontend uses Bootstrap for responsive design, ensuring a consistent shopping experience across all devices. This project strengthened both my technical skills and my ability to lead a development team effectively."
